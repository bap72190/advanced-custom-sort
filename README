#Advanced Custom Sort

This plugin provides useful post-sorting and queuing functionality like Drupal's nodequeues.

It's no longer updated, though. So this fork exists to add new features such as

- Multiple lists of sets, as opposed to one monolothic group
- A better interface to work with post ids from a set

and to clean up styling issues that arrived with WP 3.9.

If you want features, just open an issue.
